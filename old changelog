/*
//Changes by Brache Spyker:
//-updated the Frand calls to truly generate numbers from 1-100 (were previously only reaching 1-99)
//-added calls to sounds and llRequestControls() so we can tell when the user is crinkling
//-Added option to silence diaper chatter or make it whisper instead of going all over the place
//-Notecards can now be gender inspecific- two example notecards are included
//-Now as many different notecards can be added as memory allows, just like diaper textures
//-crinkle sounds and wetting sounds added (not configurable yet)
//-BUGFIX: tummy rub messings always displaying as if previously messy
//-BUGFIX: when others checked a diaper it didn't check for dry messy messages
//-heavily updated notecards
//-Added lots more security checks to the listens; people can't just spoof carer actions if they know the listen channel now
//Default gender is girl in this script
//-timesheldWet is reset properly when you wet, regardless of HOW you wet- before it only reset on timer
//-BUGFIX: once you started flooding, you didn't stop flooding
//-timesheldMess now resets under any messing not just timer
//-nearby avatars could flood the lists and cause memory crashes, so now we're flushing those lists and storing a max of 12.
//todo: add RP name option to printouts
//todo: allow others to interact with diaper but not check or change
//todo: allow toggling of carer access to diaper options menu
//todo: add more gender options, including hermaphodite, gender neutral, and RANDOM MODE
//Todo: add some restrictions on who can do what.
//BUGFIX: parseSettings was not interpreting the volume settings as floats and thus failed to load the correct values
//3/6/15:
//Moved changelist to bottom of script
//General code audit and cleanup, making names of variables more consistent with existing code
//changed some division to multiplication
//3/7/15:
//bunch of code cleanup
//allow preferences to return to main menu after
